I am a 3rd year student currently majoring the Interactive Arts and Science program.  

When relating to the field of digital humanities I am greatly interested in patterns within search engine queries. By following along with trends, you can ascertain a lot of minute detail about that time frame. As such, I would like to take that knowledge of working with these search trends and apply them in a demonstrative way.
Throughout IASC 2P02 I’ve had the opportunity working with Google Trends as well as other tools that deal with analyzing the minutia of information such as Voyant. As well, I’ve been able to work with software that can professional present information such as Reveal.js, and Palladio.

What I hope to do going forward is by working with Youtubers and Twitch Streamers to help grow their platforms by analyzing Google Trends and presenting my findings using a tool like Palladio. By analyzing patterns in internet searches and by seeing the trends of different things going viral, I will be able to help guide my clients to follow those trends and develop their platforms further.

### The Importance of the Record Player

**Abstract**

Music today is defined by the popularity and success of the record player. By allowing artists to reach a wider array of audiences around the world, the record player becomes synonymous with the printing press in regards to its impact on global culture.

When designing the presentation the goal was to outline how the record player is not a relic of the past, but instead the godfather of modern music playing capabilities that is having a sudden resurgence in the past years. As well, the inclusion of the comparison between analog and digital sound waves was paramount to drive home the point that digitally produced music is not objectively better than analog.

Over the course of designing the presentation, details about how important the record player and analog format music was shown. Within the 50s to early 80s the record player hit its tallest stride in popularizing different genres of music in different areas of the world. By being able to reach audiences globally, music bands were able to skyrocket in popularity and become wildly successful household names.

It is important to always remember the contributions of media from the past. After the switch to tapes, then CDs, then purely digital, the success of globally accessible music relies on the record player.
