# IASC 2P02 | Aaron Coomber

I am a 3rd year student currently majoring the Interactive Arts and Science program.  

When relating to the field of digital humanities I am greatly interested in patterns within search engine queries. By following along with trends, you can ascertain a lot of minute detail about that time frame. As such, I would like to take that knowledge of working with these search trends and apply them in a demonstrative way.
Throughout IASC 2P02 I’ve had the opportunity working with Google Trends as well as other tools that deal with analyzing the minutia of information such as Voyant. As well, I’ve been able to work with software that can professional present information such as Reveal.js, and Palladio.

What I hope to do going forward is by working with Youtubers and Twitch Streamers to help grow their platforms by analyzing Google Trends and presenting my findings using a tool like Palladio. By analyzing patterns in internet searches and by seeing the trends of different things going viral, I will be able to help guide my clients to follow those trends and develop their platforms further.



Within the course 2P02 I created a blog post explaining the problems with McPherson's article: 
<i>Why Are the Digital Humanities So White? or Thinking the Histories of Race and Computation</i>
